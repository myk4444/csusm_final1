                <h4>About Me</h4>
                <p>Hello. I’m Miyuki. I was born and raised in Japan. I grew up in a beautiful tropical island call Ishigaki Island. It's known for beaches and sites for snorkeling, diving and surfing. When I was young, I loved going to beaches with my parents and have picnic. My mother’s cooking was the best! My father taught me how to swim. I also taught little children swimming at Japanese swimming school.</p><br>
				
				<p>I moved to Okinawa Island when I was 18 and moved to states when I was 26. My ex-husband, son, cat and I moved to Texas and then moved to other states from east coast to west coast. I hate driving but I drove from Virginia to California… We had an awesome cat named DeeDee, moving with a cat was very interesting. We don’t have a dog any more but we had a dog named Zeus. He was like human and I miss him so much… On my free time, I enjoy making jewelries and walk by the beach. I like Mission Bay park. In summer time, I like rent kayak and beach bike there. I also like reading tarot cards and meditate.</p><br>

				<p>How I end up in Web Development… I am an Esthetician and my job gets pretty physical. I injured few years ago and I feel the job is getting difficult at times, so I decided to go into something I always wanted to learn, Graphic and Web Design. I took Digital Media classes and that made me interest in web development. I really liked bootsrap and starting to enjoy SASS more. I want to learn how to create websites from scratch. It will be sad to leave esthetic field because that’s what did for last 15 years and keeps me young…</p><br>

                <h4>You will love Ishigaki Island</h4>
                <p>I grew up in Ishigaki Island, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. Ishigaki is a city on Japan's Ishigaki Island and a jumping-off point for beaches and coral reefs. Ishigaki Island is one of biggest island of eight called “Yaeyama Island”. Connecting to a small island park, the Southern Gate Bridge offers views over the coastline. East of the city is Maezato Beach, a popular water sports hub. I created a short video about Okinawa Island.I hope you will enjoy..</p>

              <div class="well">
                <h4 id="reiki">Reiki - Universal Life Force Energy<a href="shop.html#reiki-shop"><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i></a></h4>
                <p>Today, I want to talk about what is Reiki is a Japanese healing technique and it’s used to heal, promote relaxation, reduce stress and balance of physical and spiritual well-being. Reiki can be broken down into two words “Rei” meaning wisdom or how your guidance and “Ki” meaning universal life force energy so when you put the two together, it literally means “Guided Universal Life Force Energy” and practicing Reiki is all about wielding that energy. Reiki is a natural and very safe message of healing and self-improvement that everybody can use it just takes a bit of devotion and practice to use it well. Reiki works really well in conjunction with other medical or therapeutic healing techniques such as therapy chiropractic massage or even other medical treatment works really well in conjunction with them to relieve side effects and even promote recovery.</p><br>

				<p>You can even do Reiki on your medication. You can Reiki to bless it because there’s a lot of evil in the pharmaceutical industry such as animal testing, you know all about the money greedy lowering your health to come back for more. You can Reiki on your medication and blessed it to only allow good to come through to only allow healing to come through, or you can be used for so many different things in life. When Reiki was a first started becoming popular in Japan it was actually talk to the Japanese naval officers to use as a form of first aid so you can imagine how powerful.</p><br>

				<p>When you hear about Reiki for the first time ever and you want to know how can they do Reiki and other people in their life, when you learn about Reiki… You will say “oh my gosh it would benefit this person, how can I do it for them.  But I want to say that when you’re learning about Reiki the first and most Important thing to do is to do Reiki on yourself. You can’t do Reiki effectively on somebody else unless you’ve mastered it on yourself first.</p><br>

				<p>You can never do too much Reiki. But just be aware to stay connected to the body and be aware. For example, when you remove the blockage from the heart using Reiki that blockage is no longer there, so now your heart may be raw. What that means is you’ll have to go through this life that you were already living with a new raw heart. That means you might have to relearn how to react to certain situations on life. It may mean that you have to relearn how to feel toward another loved one so there’s many different things that can happen after Reiki sessions. All very good there’s no negative side effects.</p><br>

				<p>You just have to learn how to be kind to your body and to develop a deep awareness. If you go to Reiki just thinking that you can change the world or change other people without developing a deep relationship with yourself then you make it yourself into a lot of trouble. For that reason, I recommend keeping a Reiki journal. I practice Reiki daily on myself. I am a Reiki practitioner but I can’t do Reiki on somebody else without doing it on myself first. I have to be a clear channel, I have to be super clear and super pure in order to provide the best healing I can for other people.</p><br>

				<p>I’m always learning about myself. I’m always learning how to improve my practice to grow. Some people have said that they do feel discomfort when they’re getting a Reiki session, but that discomfort is a very good sign. That means that energy is actually moving around in the body and circulating that means you’re doing it right and you’re moving it, so important thing is to stay with it and stay present.</p><br>

				<p>So, what exactly is Reiki like what is happening, what’s going on when you’re getting a Reiki session or when you’re doing it on yourself. I like to see the way I like to people to visualize is, if there is beautiful white light coming through your head and just filling your whole body like as if you’re a glass and is feeling your body up.</p><br>

				<p>What’s actually going on is that, “Ki” do you remember that second word to Reiki? Universal life force energy so 
				“Ki” is being instilled into the body and going where it needs to go, and it has sort of its own intelligence because it is one with all of us, so it knows you very well. It knows where to go.</p><br>

				<p>What is "Ki" exactly what is that means and universal life force energy “Ki”. It is actually that’s hard to explain because "Ki" cannot be measured or contained but it can be cultivated and experience in sensed. So to imagine “Ki”, you can imagine growing a garden. When you go and you cultivate a garden, you have this big messy garden, there’s weeds growing everywhere. If you want to receive a harvest from that garden, you have to go daily into the garden and pull some weeds out, water it and tend to it. If you do that every day, you will receive a great big beautiful harvest and it’s the same with Reiki when you are cultivating "Ki" you are tending to this inner garden and your spirits.</p><br>

				<p>You will receive a huge harvest from life. And that harvest is love, happiness, abundance and harmony so many different things. It just makes life happen for you and not against you.
